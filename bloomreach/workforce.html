            Chief People Officer overall assessment level remains Amber. The Covid-19 response has taken priority with Org2 Wave 3 
            planning now postponed. We have HR resources allocated across the business in support of the different Covid-19 response 
            programmes and have so far worked on the 111 online verification process, launching the Daily Check in and building 
            reporting and KPI mechanisms, to name a few, to provide employee availability and resource information.
