Welcome to the directorate dashboard homepage

Here you will find links to reports providing you with essential information that will help you better understand and manage your directorate.

These reports have been designed in line with business requirements and currently cover audit, Commercial, Finance, Risk and Workforce.
Travel and mandatory dashboards will be coming soon.

Access to the reports is restricted to users nominated by Directorate Business Leads. Any changes to access must be agreed with Business Leads.

Each report includes a short 'how to use' page, and a link to a more detailed user guide.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve the dashboards please contact your Directorate Business Lead in the first instance.
